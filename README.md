# Celidon

Celidon is a split orthilinear column staggered ergo keyboard designed with ergogen. I started making it because 1. ergo keyboards look really cool, 2. my current/old keyboard (razer cynosa v2) is terrible. It has no customizability on linux, membrane switches, bad ergonomics, and its loud and clicky. So I started working on a new keyboard using ergogen, a web tool designed for creating ergonomic keyboards. This project is my first foray into git, github, `yaml` KiCAD, hardware design, soldering, pcbs, and more that I can't think of right now.
